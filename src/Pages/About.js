          Notes is a notetaking app developed by Apple. It is provided on their
          iOS and macOS operating systems, the latter starting with OS X 10.8
          Mountain Lion. It functions as a service for making short text notes,
          which can be synchronised between devices using Apple's iCloud
          service.
